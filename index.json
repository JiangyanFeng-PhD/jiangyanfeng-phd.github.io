Recent progress in coevolution contacts prediction opens up new avenues for the de novo protein structure prediction from sequence information. However, it is still difficult to predict more than one conformation from coevolution contacts alone. This is due to the inability to deconvolute the complex signals of coevolution contacts, i.e. spatial contacts relevant for protein folding, conformational diversity, and ligand binding.\nHere, we introduce a machine learning based method, called FingerprintContacts, for extending the capabilities of coevolution contacts. We demonstrate the capabilities of FingerprintContacts on four ligand binding proteins with varying conformational motions. Furthermore, FingerprintContacts identifies small clusters of coevolution contacts which are preferentially located in the dynamically fluctuating regions. With the rapid growth in protein sequence information, we expect FingerprintContacts to be a powerful first step in structural understanding of protein functional mechanisms.\n","date":1576886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"9d43f7990734951d14240c602d58c9a0","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/project/ml_ecs/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ml_ecs/","section":"project","summary":"We developed a machine learning based method (FingerprintContacts) for predicting alternative protein conformations through combination of agglomerative clustering and bioinformatics.","tags":["Machine Learning","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Machine Learning for Protein Dynamics Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jiangyan Feng *","Jiming Chen *","Balaji Selvam *","Diwakar Shukla (*: Equal Contribution)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"bd0771f38e58f865153352c4e2f776e6","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/publication/2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T02:48:14.485204Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Computational Microscopy: Revealing Molecular Mechanisms in Plants using Molecular Dynamics Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"baef691d93494e2bf61e2a9dbc46b9d6","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/talk/oral_pru/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/oral_pru/","section":"talk","summary":"An oral talk showing the recent results in nitrate transporters.","tags":[],"title":"Elucidating Molecular Mechanism of Nitrate Transporters","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571407200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"8911f67dac393463e74072b145bdad2f","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/talk/oral_gsac_2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-18T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/oral_gsac_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Graduate resesarch oral presentation competition.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Plants for Sustainable Agriculture","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561280400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"5512b5bf5a0961ff02aec517a9583f87","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/talk/poster_grs/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/poster_grs/","section":"talk","summary":"Poster presentation at Gordon Research Conference (Mechanisms of Membrane Transport).","tags":[],"title":"How NarK Antiports Nitrate and Nitrite?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We developed a “motif finding” program to discover patterns in DNA sequences and tested it against the benchmark.\nThere are three major components:\n Building a benchmark.

However, precise kinetics predictions of MSMs heavily rely on the features selected to describe the system. Despite the importance of feature selection for large system, determining an optimal set of features remains a difficult unsolved problem.\nHere, we introduce an automatic approach to optimize feature selection based on genetic algorithms (GA), which adaptively evolves the most fitted solution according to natural selection laws. The power of the GA-based method is illustrated on long atomistic folding simulations of four proteins, varying in length from 28 to 80 residues. Due to the diversity of tested proteins, we expect that our method will be extensible to other proteins and drive MSM building to a more objective protocol.\n","date":1545350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"a949480f12952d2703e60973ea9ed962","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/project/ga/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ga/","section":"project","summary":"We developed a genetic algorithm based technique to optimize feature selection for dimensionality reduction.","tags":["Genetic Algorithm","Feature Selection","Dimensionality Reduction"],"title":"Automatic Feature Selection for Dimensionality Reduction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Qihua Chen *","Jiangyan Feng *","Shriyaa Mittal","Diwakar Shukla (*: Equal Contribution)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"4d2656f21ec285dae5d97fbaad6abb54","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/publication/chen-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T02:46:59.988152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Feature Selection in Markov State Models Using Genetic Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539334800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579751258,"objectID":"672050f63390358941affb2d50a62b33","permalink":"https://JiangyanFeng-PhD.github.io/talk/poster_gsac_2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-12T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/poster_gsac_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Graduate resesarch poster presentation competition.","tags":[],"title":"Characterizing Protein Conformational Dynamics using Evolutionary Couplings and Reinforcement Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiangyan Feng","Olabode O.
