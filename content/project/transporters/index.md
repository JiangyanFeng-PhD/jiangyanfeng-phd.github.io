title: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Nutrient Transport in Plants
summary: We performed large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on petascale supercomputer (Bluewaters Supercomputer) to unravel the molecular mechanisms of 3 different transporters (plant nitrate transporter NRT1.1, bacteria nitrate/nitrite antiporter NarK, and bacteria nitrate symporter NarU).

We focus on developing and employing machine learning, data science, and molecular modelling techqniues to understand the complex dynamic mechanisms of transporter proteins.

There are three key components:
1. Performing large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on petascale supercomputer to unravel the molecular mechanisms of 3 different transporters (plant nitrate transporter NRT1.1, bacteria nitrate/nitrite antiporter NarK, and bacteria nitrate symporter NarU).
2. Constructing Markov State Models to analyze high-dimensional and long-timescale simulation data.
3. Developing and employing state-of-the-art machine learning and data science techniques (e.g. genetic algorithm, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, clustering, and cross-validation) to optimize parameters for Markov State Models constructions and to extract insights from high dimensional data.
