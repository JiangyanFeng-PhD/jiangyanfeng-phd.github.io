I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in the <strong>Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</strong> at Univerisity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am also enrolled in <strong>Computational Science and Engineering</strong> Graduate Concentration Program. 

My research focuses on developing and employing <strong>atomistic simulations, machine learning, and data science approaches </strong> for understanding complex biological processes (i.e. protein conformational dynamics).
